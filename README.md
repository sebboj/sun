This project allows you to see how the sunrise and sunset changes across the year and across the globe.

Clone the project and open a terminal in the directory of the project.
Run ```activate_venv.bat``` to start the virtual environment.

In ```horasdeluz.py``` you will find the console input toggle at the bottom of the file.

Toggle on console input and run ```python horasdeluz.py``` to calculate sun hours in the console.

To see vizualisations please go to the ```worldwide.py``` file and configure the desired latitude and longitude as well as the desired Y axis of the graph.
You may choose from ```Y_axis_sunrise```, ```Y_axis_midday```, and ```Y_axis_sunset```.

After configuring the axes and labels, run ```python worldwide.py```.
This will take a little patience and once it is done processing you will see the matplotlib graph appear on your taskbar.

Run ```deactivate_venv.bat``` to close the virtual environment once finished.
